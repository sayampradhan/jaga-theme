# Jaga Theme

Welcome to **Jaga Theme**, an aesthetic Visual Studio Code theme inspired by the divine presence of Lord Shree Jagannath. This theme reflects the beauty and vibrancy of Puri's Jagannath Temple, encapsulating a rich color palette that evokes a sense of spirituality, devotion, and grandeur.

## About Lord Shree Jagannath

Lord Shree Jagannath is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, primarily worshipped in the ancient city of Puri, Odisha, India. His name signifies "Lord of the Universe" (Jagat meaning world or universe, and Nath meaning master). Alongside His siblings, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra, He is venerated as the supreme deity of the Jagannath temple, one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.

The annual **Rath Yatra** (Chariot Festival) of Lord Jagannath is a global spectacle, attracting millions of devotees. The festival symbolizes unity and inclusivity, as the Lord is brought out from the temple for all, regardless of caste or creed, to seek His blessings.

The colors used in this theme are symbolic, drawing from the vibrant festivals, spiritual atmosphere, and the divine aura of Lord Jagannath's presence in Puri. Immerse yourself in the spiritual ambiance while coding with Jaga Theme!
